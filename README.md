__WARNING__: The prefered way to handle a sequence of values in Go is _slice_, do not use this module
for any serious purpose.

The functions as first class object gives the possibility to implement lists in Lisp, but I'm not sure
whether Go provides tail-recursion optimization or not, and the implementation here is extremely low-efficient.
